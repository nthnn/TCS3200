# TCS3200 Color Sensor Arduino Library

![Arduino CI Workflow](https://github.com/nthnn/TCS3200/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Color sensing is a crucial aspect of many modern applications, from color detection and sorting in industrial processes to smart home automation systems. The TCS3200 color sensor is a widely used device for color sensing due to its simplicity, accuracy, and ease of integration. To harness the full potential of this sensor, this library was developed, a powerful and user-friendly API that allows Arduino developers to interface with the TCS3200 sensor effortlessly.

The TCS3200 color sensor is a programmable device that can detect and measure the intensity of light across different color channels. It comes equipped with an array of photodiodes, each covered by a specific color filter: red, green, blue, and clear. The clear photodiode captures ambient light and is used to calculate the overall intensity.

Also, the sensor has two main operating modes: frequency and analog output. In frequency mode, the sensor outputs a square wave with a frequency proportional to the intensity of light detected. In analog output mode, the sensor provides a voltage output proportional to the intensity.

## Library Overview

The TCS3200 Arduino Library is designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind. It offers a wide range of functionalities, from basic color sensing to advanced features like white balancing, color space conversions, and nearest color detection.

Here's an overview of the key functions and their roles in the library:

- **Initialization**

    The `begin()` function initializes the TCS3200 sensor by configuring the necessary pins and setting default integration time and frequency scaling.

- **Color Reading**

    Access the red, green, and blue intensity values captured by the TCS3200 color sensor. These raw RGB values can be used to analyze the color composition of an object or its surroundings. The library provides four functions to read the intensity of each color channel: `read_red()`, `read_green()`, `read_blue()`, and `read_clear()`. The clear channel reading is used for calibration and to calculate the RGB color intensity values.

- **Calibration**

    Achieve better color accuracy with sensor calibration. The library includes methods to calibrate the sensor in both light and dark environments, resulting in more reliable and consistent color measurements.

    The `calibrate()`, `calibrate_light()`, and `calibrate_dark()` function enables calibration of the sensor. Calibration involves capturing readings for both the lightest and darkest colors to establish the range for color intensity mapping.

- **Integration Time**

    Set integration time and frequency scaling to adapt to different lighting environments. The `integration_time()` function allows users to get and set the integration time for each color reading, affecting the accuracy and sensitivity of color measurements on calibration. Integration time determines the period for which the sensor collects light data while calibrating.

- **Frequency Scaling**

    The `frequency_scaling()` function gets and sets the scaling factor for the sensor's frequency output to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and response time.

- **White Balancing**

    Perform white balancing to adjust color measurements for different light sources. By setting the white balance, color readings can be normalized to match the true colors under various lighting conditions, improving the accuracy of color detection. The `white_balance()` functions provide the ability to calibrate the sensor based on a known white color.

- **Color Space Conversions**

    The library offers functions to convert RGB color values to other color spaces such as HSV, CMYK, and CIE 1931 XYZ.

    - **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)**: Convert RGB colors to the HSV color space. HSV representation provides intuitive and easy-to-understand values for color manipulation and analysis. Hue represents the color, saturation measures color intensity, and value indicates brightness.

    - **CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black)**: Transform RGB colors to CMYK, a color model commonly used in printing. CMYK values represent the amount of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black needed to reproduce the given RGB color accurately on printed media.

    - **CIE 1931 XYZ (CIE 1931 Color Space)**: Convert RGB colors to CIE 1931 XYZ color space, which approximates human vision. This color space provides tristimulus values that represent the physiological response of the human eye to light.

- **Nearest Color Detection**

    Find the nearest color from a given set of colors. This feature is useful in applications where specific color matching is required, such as sorting objects based on color or identifying color categories. The `nearest_color()` template function takes an array of color labels and `RGBColor` values and returns the nearest color label based on the current sensor readings.

- **Upper and Lower Bound Interrupts**

    Configure upper and lower bound interrupts for specific color thresholds. When the measured color crosses these thresholds, user-defined callback functions can be triggered, enabling real-time color-based event handling.

- **Chroma Calculation**

    Calculate the chroma value from RGB readings, providing an indication of the purity and saturation of a color. Higher chroma values signify more vibrant colors, while lower values indicate less saturated or desaturated colors.

- **RGB Dominant Color**

    Identify the dominant color from the RGB readings. This feature can be valuable when you need to determine the most prominent color in a scene or object.

- **Examples and Documentation**

    The TCS3200 Arduino Library comes with well-documented examples and usage guidelines to help developers get started quickly. The provided examples cover a wide range of functionalities, from basic color detection to complex color space conversions.
